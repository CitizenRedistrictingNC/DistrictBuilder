      data must be in a tab-delimited text file where:

      column 1 = geounit1_id
      column 2 = geounit2_id
      column 3 = cost/distance/travel time, etc.

      The geounit_id's *must* be the same IDs that make up the portable_ids in
      the geounit table.

      This text file must not have have a header row.

      Please note, at this time the data import and adjacency calculator do not support
      data where the cost between A->B != B->A.

                  Each Field item defines a field in the shapefile that
                  describes a different part of the geographic unit.

                  A "name" type field is used to display the name of the
                  geographic unit.

                  A "portable" type field is used to store the FIPS/GEOID
                  of the geographic unit, which is shared with other GIS
                  systems.

                  A "tree" type field is used to store information about
                  the geography, and where it resides in the tree. This type
                  of field requires a "pos" attribute, which declares which
                  position in the tree the field belongs (starting at 0);
                  a "width" attribute is also required to declare how wide
                  this portion of the tree code is. This is helpful when
                  the treecode may not be zero padded.
