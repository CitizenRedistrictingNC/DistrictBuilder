SLDs
====

This folder exists to hold all the SLDs used by DistrictBuilder.

SLD files are StyledLayerDescriptor documents, which contain cartographic
styling for the geographic features that are edited in the DistrictBuilder
application.

During the setup of GeoServer, this folder will be populated with SLD
documents that control the way that the geography will appear in map tiles
and as vector features.
