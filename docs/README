The Public Mapping Project
http://sourceforge.net/projects/publicmapping/

== Prerequisites ==

This software requires a few other pieces of free software to run.  Before 
you can run the public mapping web site, you'll need to install and 
configure:

Apache v 2.2
Geoserver v 2.0.2
Postgresql v 8.4 w/ PostGIS
Python v 2.6
Django v 1.1

== Installation ==

  1. Check out the public mapping projects to the /projects directory of 
     your linux installation.

    > mkdir /projects
    > cd /projects
    > svn co https://publicmapping.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/publicmapping publicmapping

  2. Create a "local" directory next to the trunk - this is where your 
     machine-specific settings and data will go

    > mkdir /projects/publicmapping/local

  3. Copy the settings_sample.ini file to your local settings folder and 
     name it settings.ini

    > cp /projects/publicmapping/trunk/docs/settings_sample.ini /projects/publicmapping/local/settings.ini

  4. Run the publicmapping_db.sql script in the sql directory.

    > sudo -s postgres psql -f /projects/publicmapping/trunk/sql/publicmapping_db.sql

  5. This will create a publicmapping db from the template_postgis 
     template, along with a publicmapping user role.  The publicmapping 
     user will be assigned all permissions and ownership on the db.

  6. Check out your settings.ini folder and make sure it's pointing to the
     correct DB and that your DB is accessible. You may want to adjust the 
     value of the map server, too.
     
  7. Run the python command in the settings file to generate a secret key 
     for your application and copy it into the settings.ini file.

  8. Run the django syncdb command to create the database
  
    > python /projects/publicmapping/trunk/django/publicmapping/manage.py syncdb

  9. To import your data, you'll need to configure the importshape.py 
     script in the "python" directory. Using your favorite text editor, 
     update the shapefile paths and subject configuration to match your 
     data.

 10. Run the importshapes script from withing the django shell

    > cd /projects/publicmapping/trunk/python
    > python ../django/publicmapping/manage.py shell
    >>> execfile('importshapes.py')

 11. The script may take a long time to run.  It will import the geographic
     data from the shapes and create the links and django models necessary 
     to run the application.  Once it's run, you can exit the shell by 
     typing:

    >>> quit()

 12. Django serves up SLD files to clients, and need this mime type added
     to the system's known mime types in order to serve the content
     properly.

     a. Open the file /etc/mime.types in your favorite editor.
     b. Find the line that starts with "application/xml"
     c. Add " sld" to the end of this line, after "xml xsl xsd"

 13. Now that you have the app configured and your data imported, you can 
     run the app using Django's testing server
     
    > python /projects/publicmapping/trunk/django/publicmapping/manage.py runserver

 14. You will see a notice that your server is running and you can access 
     your application at 127.0.0.1:8000  Enter that location into your 
     browser on the local machine and you should be able to use the 
     application.

 15. Running the application from the django development server is good for
     setup, but for a production environment, you will want to configure
     Apache:

     a. Copy the file "publicmapping.apache" into the "sites-available" 
        Apache config directory (typically /etc/apache2/sites-available/)
     b. Create a symbolic link to this file from the "sites-enabled"
        directory:

       > cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
       > sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/publicmapping.apache 001-publicmapping

     c. If you are NOT running the public mapping project as the default
        web site in Apache, you will have to edit publicmapping.apache to
        reflect your configuration (e.g. VirtualHost directives).
     d. If you ARE running the public mapping project as the default web
        site in Apache, remove the default site configuration:

       > sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

     e. Make sure you have the following modules for apache enabled: proxy, 
        proxy_http, rewrite, and wsgi
        
       > a2enmod proxy proxy_http rewrite wsgi

     f. You may need to update /etc/apache2/mods-available/proxy.conf  If you see

            Deny from All

        change it to

            Allow from All

     f. To support reports, you'll need to run a separate virtual host on a port
        other than your public mapping project application.  You can set this in
        your main apache config, or in /etc/apache2/ports.conf in some linux distros. 
        Add these two lines to run reports on port 8081.  If you choose a different 
        port, you'll need to update your publicmapping apache file

            NameVirtualHost: *:8081
            Listen 8081
