== Amazon EC2 instances ==
    If you want to launch a publicmapping instance from an AMI, you can do so from the 
    AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home)

    1. Find the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you want to use.  Check publicmapping.org to
        get the ID of the latest AMI.

    2. Right-click on the AMI and click Launch Instance.  You can choose whichever size
        image you'd like.  You must also choose a key pair from those you've created in
        Amazon.  Make sure your firewall rules allow access on ports 80 and 443 (http(s)),
        22 (SSH for administration), 25 (smtp) and 465 (smtps) for all users of the site.
        To administer geoserver, you'll need to allow connections on port 8080 for your
        administrators. Port 8081 may also be useful in troubleshooting if BARD reporting
        does not work.

    3. Once the Instance is created and running, you can view it on the Instances window
        in the AWS Console.

    4. Right-click on your instance in the console and select "Connect".  You'll be shown
        the command to SSH to your new Instance.  You'll have to have your private key
        for the AWS keypair you chose earlier.
      
        NB: The instances do not use the name "root" for the ssh account to connect with.
        These servers are made from Canonical images and use the account name "ubuntu", e.g.

             ssh -i publicmapping.pem ubuntu@ec2-75-101-251-183.compute-1.amazonaws.com 

    5. Once you've connected to the AMI, you'll need to change the MAP_SERVER value in your 
        /projects/publicmapping/local/settings.ini file to the public DNS name of your instance.
        This name can be found in the AWS console in the instance description as "Public DNS" or
        by running the following command on the instance
         
        curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname/
    
    6. Once you've changed your map server settings, restart apache with the command:
        
        sudo service apache2 restart

    7. You should now be able to connect to your web application at the public DNS address.
       (This is viewable from the EC2 console) 

    8. By default, there is an administrator account on the web app called "Admin" with the
       password "admin".  You should change this through either the publicmapping app (Use the
       "My Account" link in the corner) or through the Django admin application (accessible
       through the URL http://<public DNS>/admin/)
